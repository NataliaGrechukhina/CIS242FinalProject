# FinalProjectCIS242
This website was created by Natalia Grechukhina to show what knowledge of CIS 242 Web Development II class was gained during this Winter Quarter 2021.

The Final project website consists of three HTML files, CSS file and JavaScript files. 

The files are named: 
- order.html
- summary.html
- custinfo.html
- styles.css
- cookies.js
- library.js

This project was based on a demo version of another project provided by the instructor of this class as example, which greatly helped me in solving some tasks of my Final project. 

The main idea for this website is selling snacks in wholesale format, not by 1 bag.
Website propose to customer choose size of box, regular or gift box, choose filling of box. Customer has option to choose specific filling of the box. The Order Summary goes through from page one to last page and show to customer Total price.

order.html page shows customer different options for order and Total price.
custinfo.html page collect the customer's delivery information, shows notification if required fields is empty, also point on the field if it is filled not correct such as wrong format of phone number.
summary.html page reflect all information collected before about delivery information and order summary. Also, summary.html page shows that order will be received by customer within 1 week.
